Thus, {STRING} contains a unique scoring-framework based on benchmarks of the different types of associations against a common reference set, integrated in a single confidence score per prediction. The graphical representation of the network of inferred, weighted protein interactions provides a high-level view of functional linkage, facilitating the analysis of modularity in biological processes. {STRING} is updated continuously, and currently contains 261 033 orthologs in 89 fully sequenced genomes.

We also employ a new metric, the {Signal-to-Noise} Ratio of protein complexes embedded in each network, to assess the power of the different methods. Seven confidence assignment schemes, including those of Bader et al., Deane et al., Deng et al., Sharan et al., and Qi et al., are compared in this {work.CONCLUSION:Although} the performance of each assignment scheme varies depending on the particular metric used for assessment, we observe that Deng et al. yields the best performance overall (in three out of four viable measures).

Thus the more semantically similar the gene function annotations are among the interacting proteins, more likely the interaction is physiologically relevant. However, most semantic similarity measures used for {PPI} confidence assessment do not consider the unequal depth of term hierarchies in different classes of cellular location, molecular function, and biological process ontologies of {GO} and thus may over-or under-estimate {similarity.RESULTS:We} describe an improved algorithm, Topological Clustering Semantic Similarity {(TCSS)}, to compute semantic similarity between {GO} terms annotated to proteins in interaction datasets. Our algorithm, considers unequal depth of biological knowledge representation in different branches of the {GO} graph. The central idea is to divide the {GO} graph into sub-graphs and score {PPIs} higher if participating proteins belong to the same sub-graph as compared to if they belong to different {sub-graphs.CONCLUSIONS:The} {TCSS} algorithm performs better than other semantic similarity measurement techniques that we evaluated in terms of their performance on distinguishing true from false protein interactions, and correlation with gene expression and protein families.

	abstract = {As more and more high-throughput protein-protein interaction data are collected, the task of estimating the reliability of different data sets becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we present our study of two groups of protein-protein interaction data, the physical interaction data and the protein complex data, and estimate the reliability of these data sets using three different measurements: (1) the distribution of gene expression correlation coefficients, (2) the reliability based on gene expression correlation coefficients, and (3) the accuracy of protein function predictions. We develop a maximum likelihood method to estimate the reliability of protein interaction data sets according to the distribution of correlation coefficients of gene expression profiles of putative interacting protein pairs. The results of the three measurements are consistent with each other. The {MIPS} protein complex data have the highest mean gene expression correlation coefficients (0.256) and the highest accuracy in predicting protein functions (70\% sensitivity and specificity), while Ito's Yeast two-hybrid data have the lowest mean (0.041) and the lowest accuracy (15\% sensitivity and specificity). Uetz's data are more reliable than Ito's data in all three measurements, and the {TAP} protein complex data are more reliable than the {HMS-PCI} data in all three measurements as well. The complex data sets generally perform better in function predictions than do the physical interaction data sets. Proteins in complexes are shown to be more highly correlated in gene expression. The results confirm that the components of a protein complex can be assigned to functions that the complex carries out within a cell. There are three interaction data sets different from the above two groups: the genetic interaction data, the in-silico data and the syn-express data. Their capability of predicting protein functions generally falls between that of the {Y2H} data and that of the {MIPS} protein complex data.

Several interaction network weighting schemes have been proposed so far in the literature in order to eliminate the noise inherent in interactome data. In this paper, we propose a novel weighting scheme and apply it to the S. cerevisiae interactome. Complex prediction rates are improved by up to 39\%, depending on the clustering algorithm {applied.RESULTS:We} adopt a two step procedure. During the first step, by applying both novel and well established protein-protein interaction {(PPI)} weighting methods, weights are introduced to the original interactome graph based on the confidence level that a given interaction is a true-positive one. The second step applies clustering using established algorithms in the field of graph theory, as well as two variations of Spectral clustering. The clustered interactome networks are also cross-validated against the confirmed protein complexes present in the {MIPS} {database.CONCLUSIONS:The} results of our experimental work demonstrate that interactome graph weighting methods clearly improve the clustering results of several clustering algorithms.

Using Bayesian network approaches, we show that protein-protein interactions from high-throughput data supported by one or more genomic features have a higher likelihood ratio and hence are more likely to be real interactions. Our method has a high sensitivity (90\%) and good specificity (63\%). We show that 56\% of the interactions from high-throughput experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have high reliability. We use the method to estimate the number of true interactions in the high-throughput protein-protein interaction data sets in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens to be 27\%, 18\% and 68\% respectively.

Using a cross-genome comparison, we show that (a) the older a protein, the better connected it is, and (b) the number of interactions a protein gains during its evolution is proportional to its connectivity. Therefore, preferential attachment governs the protein network evolution. Evolutionary mechanisms leading to such preference and some implications are discussed.},

We exploit the neighborhood cohesiveness property of small-world networks to assess confidence for individual protein–protein interactions. By ascertaining how well each protein–protein interaction (edge) fits the pattern of a small-world network, we stratify even those edges with identical experimental evidence.

This is especially important when integrating high throughput biological data sources because of the high noise rates and the many missing values. In this paper we present a new method to compute such similarities for the task of classifying pairs of proteins as interacting or not. Our method uses direct and indirect information about interaction pairs to constructs a random forest (a collection of decision tress) from a training set. The resulting forest is used to determine the similarity between protein pairs and this similarity is used by a classification algorithm (a modified {kNN)} to classify protein pairs. Testing the algorithm on yeast data indicates that it is able to improve coverage to 20\% of interacting pairs with a false positive rate of 50\%. These results compare favorably with all previously suggested methods for this task indicating the importance of robust similarity estimates.},

Publicly available data have previously been provided in a broad array of diverse formats, making access to this very difficult. The publication and wide implementation of the Human Proteome Organisation Proteomics Standards Initiative Molecular Interactions {(HUPO} {PSI-MI)} format in 2004 was a major step towards the establishment of a single, unified format by which molecular interactions should be presented, but focused purely on protein-protein interactions. {RESULTS:} The {HUPO-PSI} has further developed the {PSI-MI} {XML} schema to enable the description of interactions between a wider range of molecular types, for example nucleic acids, chemical entities, and molecular complexes. Extensive details about each supported molecular interaction can now be captured, including the biological role of each molecule within that interaction, detailed description of interacting domains, and the kinetic parameters of the interaction. The format is supported by data management and analysis tools and has been adopted by major interaction data providers. Additionally, a simpler, tab-delimited format {MITAB2.5} has been developed for the benefit of users who require only minimal information in an easy to access configuration. {CONCLUSION:} The {PSI-MI} {XML2.5} and {MITAB2.5} formats have been jointly developed by interaction data producers and providers from both the academic and commercial sector, and are already widely implemented and well supported by an active development community. {PSI-MI} {XML2.5} enables the description of highly detailed molecular interaction data and facilitates data exchange between databases and users without loss of information. {MITAB2.5} is a simpler format appropriate for fast Perl parsing or loading into Microsoft Excel.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Proteins and protein complexes coordinate their activity to execute cellular functions. In a number of experimental settings, including synthetic genetic arrays, genetic perturbations and {RNAi} screens, scientists identify a small set of protein interactions of interest. A working hypothesis is often that these interactions are the observable phenotypes of some functional process, which is not directly observable. Confirmatory analysis requires finding other pairs of proteins whose interaction may be additional phenotypical evidence about the same functional process. Extant methods for finding additional protein interactions rely heavily on the information in the newly identified set of interactions. For instance, these methods leverage the attributes of the individual proteins directly, in a supervised setting, in order to find relevant protein pairs. A small set of protein interactions provides a small sample to train parameters of prediction methods, thus leading to low {confidence.Results:} We develop {RBSets}, a computational approach to ranking protein interactions rooted in analogical reasoning; that is, the ability to learn and generalize relations between objects. Our approach is tailored to situations where the training set of protein interactions is small, and leverages the attributes of the individual proteins indirectly, in a Bayesian ranking setting that is perhaps closest to propensity scoring in mathematical psychology. We find that {RBSets} leads to good performance in identifying additional interactions starting from a small evidence set of interacting proteins, for which an underlying biological logic in terms of functional processes and signaling pathways can be established with some confidence. Our approach is scalable and can be applied to large databases with minimal computational overhead. Our results suggest that analogical reasoning within a Bayesian ranking problem is a promising new approach for real-time biological {discovery.Availability:} Java code is available at: {www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/{\textasciitilde}rbas.Contact:} airoldi@fas.harvard.edu; kheller@mit.edu; ricardo@stats.ucl.ac.uk},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Many} complex random networks have been found to be scale-free. Existing literature on scale-free networks has rarely considered potential false positive and false negative links in the observed networks, especially in biological networks inferred from high-throughput experiments. Therefore, it is important to study the impact of these measurement errors on the topology of the observed {networks.RESULTS:This} article addresses the impact of erroneous links on network topological inference and explores possible error mechanisms for scale-free networks with an emphasis on Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein interaction networks. We study this issue by both theoretical derivations and simulations. We show that the ignorance of erroneous links in network analysis may lead to biased estimates of the scale parameter and recommend robust estimators in such scenarios. Possible error mechanisms of yeast protein interaction networks are explored by comparisons between real data and simulated {data.CONCLUSION:Our} studies show that, in the presence of erroneous links, the connectivity distribution of scale-free networks is still scale-free for the middle range connectivities, but can be greatly distorted for low and high connecitivities. It is more appropriate to use robust estimators such as the least trimmed mean squares estimator to estimate the scale parameter gamma under such circumstances. Moreover, we show by simulation studies that the scale-free property is robust to some error mechanisms but untenable to others. The simulation results also suggest that different error mechanisms may be operating in the yeast protein interaction networks produced from different data sources. In the {MIPS} gold standard protein interaction data, there appears to be a high rate of false negative links, and the false negative and false positive rates are more or less constant across proteins with different connectivities. However, the error mechanism of yeast two-hybrid data may be very different, where the overall false negative rate is low and the false negative rates tend to be higher for links involving proteins with more interacting partners.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:As} protein interactions mediate most cellular mechanisms, protein-protein interaction networks are essential in the study of cellular processes. Consequently, several large-scale interactome mapping projects have been undertaken, and protein-protein interactions are being distilled into databases through literature curation; yet protein-protein interaction data are still far from comprehensive, even in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Estimating the interactome size is important for evaluating the completeness of current datasets, in order to measure the remaining efforts that are {required.RESULTS:We} examined the yeast interactome from a new perspective, by taking into account how thoroughly proteins have been studied. We discovered that the set of literature-curated protein-protein interactions is qualitatively different when restricted to proteins that have received extensive attention from the scientific community. In particular, these interactions are less often supported by yeast two-hybrid, and more often by more complex experiments such as biochemical activity assays. Our analysis showed that high-throughput and literature-curated interactome datasets are more correlated than commonly assumed, but that this bias can be corrected for by focusing on well-studied proteins. We thus propose a simple and reliable method to estimate the size of an interactome, combining literature-curated data involving well-studied proteins with high-throughput data. It yields an estimate of at least 37, 600 direct physical protein-protein interactions in S. {cerevisiae.CONCLUSIONS:Our} method leads to higher and more accurate estimates of the interactome size, as it accounts for interactions that are genuine yet difficult to detect with commonly-used experimental assays. This shows that we are even further from completing the yeast interactome map than previously expected.},

This allows direct comparison and integration of different classes of data. The resulting probabilistic gene network estimates the functional coupling between genes. Within this framework, we reconstructed an extensive, high-quality functional gene network for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, consisting of 4681 (∼81\%) of the known yeast genes linked by ∼34,000 probabilistic linkages comparable in accuracy to small-scale interaction assays. The integrated linkages distinguish true from false-positive interactions in earlier data sets; new interactions emerge from genes' network contexts, as shown for genes in chromatin modification and ribosome biogenesis.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference is usually presented as a method for determining how scientific belief should be modified by data. Although Bayesian methodology has been one of the most active areas of statistical development in the past 20 years, medical researchers have been reluctant to embrace what they perceive as a subjective approach to data analysis. It is little understood that Bayesian methods have a data-based core, which can be used as a calculus of evidence. This core is the Bayes factor, which in its simplest form is also called a likelihood ratio. The minimum Bayes factor is objective and can be used in lieu of the P value as a measure of the evidential strength. Unlike P values, Bayes factors have a sound theoretical foundation and an interpretation that allows their use in both inference and decision making. Bayes factors show that P values greatly overstate the evidence against the null hypothesis. Most important, Bayes factors require the addition of background knowledge to be transformed into inferences--probabilities that a given conclusion is right or wrong. They make the distinction clear between experimental evidence and inferential conclusions while providing a framework in which to combine prior with current evidence.},

	abstract = {High throughput protein interaction data sets have proven to be notoriously noisy. Although it is possible to focus on interactions with higher reliability by using only those that are backed up by two or more lines of evidence, this approach invariably throws out the majority of available data. A more optimal use could be achieved by incorporating the probabilities associated with all available interactions into the analysis. We present a novel method for estimating error rates associated with specific protein interaction data sets, as well as with individual interactions given the data sets in which they appear. As a bonus, we also get an estimate for the total number of protein interactions in yeast. Certain types of false positive results can be identified and removed, resulting in a significant improvement in quality of the data set. For co-purification data sets, we show how we can reach a tradeoff between the "spoke" and "matrix" representation of interactions within co-purified groups of proteins to achieve an optimal false positive error rate.},
